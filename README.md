I conducted a detailed analysis of a loan dataset obtained from Kaggle, exploring factors that influence loan approval and denial, such as age, income, education level, loan amount, interest rates, and home ownership. My approach began with an extensive data cleaning process, where I addressed missing values, duplicates, and outlier particularly with age data, where age above 130 were removed based on domain knowledge. Once the data was cleaned, I investigated several key analyses, which are visualized in my BI dashboard. These include:

Total loan amount by interest rate
Average loan interest rate by loan amount
Loan amount by education level
Average loan amount by gender
Loan amount by home ownership status
Impact of age on loan amount
Top reasons for loans by customers.
In addition, I used cards to highlight key insights and trends within the dataset, providing a comprehensive view of the factors that impact loan decisions.

**KEY OBSERVATIONS:**

**MOST COMMON REASON FOR LOAN:** Education

**BORROWERS WHO BORROW MORE BY EDUCATION LEVEL:** Bachelor

**GENDER WHO BORROW MORE:** On Average, male borrow more

**DOES AGE IMPACT LOAN AMOUNT**? Somewhat

**DOES INTEREST RATE INCREASE WHEN LOAN AMOUNT INCREASES?** Yes

**AVERAGE BORROWER’S INCOME:** $79K

**TOTAL AMOUNT BORROWED ON EDUCATION:** 87m

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

Focus on Education Loan: To better serve this need, lenders could consider offering tailored loans types with favorable terms for educational purposes, such as lower interest rates or longer repayment periods. This would not only attract more borrowers but also help support access to education and long-term financial stability.

Target Borrowers pursuing bachelor’s degree: I recommend that Lenders consider offering specialized lending options or incentives tailored to individuals with a bachelor’s degree, such as competitive interest rates or flexible repayment options. This approach could attract a key demographic while supporting their financial needs as they advance in their careers.

Adress Gender Loan Gaps: Lenders could explore offering tailored loan offers with favorable terms for female borrowers, such as lower interest rates or increased borrowing limits, to help bridge this gap and promote financial equality. Targeted marketing and financial literacy programs could further encourage women to take out larger loans when necessary.

Lender should leverage on Borrowers income: Lenders could consider offering more customized loan products, such as higher credit limits or more flexible repayment options, to borrowers in this income bracket. By catering to the financial capacity of higher-earning individuals, lenders can attract more qualified borrowers and potentially increase loan volumes.

Tailor Loans to Age Borrowing Trend: Lenders could consider adjusting loan offerings based on age demographics, providing larger loan amounts or more flexible terms for borrowers in the 60-65 age range, while ensuring that loan products for older borrowers consider potential financial stability concerns. Tailoring products to these age-specific trends could help optimize lending strategies.
